Title: Extreme Value modelling using Partially-Interpretable Neural Networks
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Author: Jordan Richards
Maintainer: The package maintainer <jordan.richards@kaust.edu.sa>
Description: Methodology for fitting marginal extreme value (and associated) models using partially-interpretable neural networks. Networks are trained using the R interface to Keras with custom loss functions taken to be penalised versions of the negative log-likelihood for associated models.
