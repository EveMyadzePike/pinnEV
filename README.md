#  Extreme Value modelling through Partially-Interpretable Neural Networks
Methodology for fitting marginal extreme value (and associated) models using partially-interpretable neural networks. Networks are trained using the [R interfact to Keras](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/keras/index.html) with custom loss functions taken to be a penalised version of the negative log-likelihood for associated models.
